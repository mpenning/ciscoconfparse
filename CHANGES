1.2.0   20150124 Major parser rewrite: streamline parser, less spaghetti code, add ccp_abc.is_config_line.  This version *should* parse Cisco Nexus syntax now (but parse Cisco Nexus configs with ignore_blank_lines=False).  Implement enhancement in github issue #6
1.1.24  20150123 Fix github issue #13 (ciscoconfparse did not parse correctly when ignore_blank_lines=True); some parent assignments were missed if blank lines were in the configuration

        documentation more friendly to mobile devices; substitute the 
        sphinx_bootstrap_theme instead of the sphinxdoc theme.  Add line 
        highlights in code examples which hopefully make complex examples more 
        clear.
0.9.35  20140430 Update docstrings with more examples.  Improve doc Makefile
0.9.34  20140429 Update IOSCfgLine objects with a recursive delete, which

        Python3.3 (due to how __hash__() is computed).
0.9.13  20140209 Fixed Python3 compatibility, which broke a few builds ago.  
        Including ipaddr-py (patched for Python3) until versions of Python3 
        typically include it (right now, Debian 7.3 has Python3.2 without
        ipaddr-py)

        inserting and deleting lines via insert_before(), insert_after(), and
        insert_after_child()

0.9.0   20121230 Add RST documentation into the archives and fix more build 
        issues
0.8.6   20121230 Fix packaging problems introduced when I switched to a native
        mercurial repository (examples/* and configs/* were not automatically
        packaged in the .egg / .tar.gz anymore...)
0.8.5   20121229 - Added custom comment delimiters that were in the 0.8.3a private 
        build.  Converted the unicode backslash to a true unicode instance.
0.8.4   20121229 - Add doctests, code maintenance, and more documentation fixes.
        Improved examples/req_cfgspec_all_diff.py and 
        examples/req_cfgspec_excl_diff.py.
0.8.3   20091016 - Documentation updates.  PEP8 formatting
0.8.2   20090808 - Fixed a fatal crash in find_blocks()
0.8.1   20090719 - Code reorganization.  Fixed a bad RuntimeError.  Promoted to
        production-quality at this point
0.8.0   20071011 - Removed residual internal debugging from the CiscoPassword
        class.  Added an 'ignore_ws' options to all public methods, except
	req_cfgspec_excl_diff; this option will make the method's matches 
	ignore whitespace differences (useful in some CatOS configurations).  
	After much deliberation, I have removed the explicit 'False' return 
	values for methods that do not match; instead I am returning an empty 
	list (which will test False).  Apologies for breaking any existing 
	code, but I decided against leaving beta with this behavior.  Removed
	all sys.exit(0) statements in favor of raising a RuntimeError.

0.7.5   20070804 - Fixed a bug in the parse() method, which was associating
        grandchildren as children of the grandparent.   Added unit tests.

0.7.0   20070803 - Added an optional parameter to the find_lines(), 
        find_children(), find_all_children(), and find_blocks() methods.  This
	parameter will allow the user to specify whether he wants an "exact"
	match or a normal regex match.  Also fixed a bug that broke parsing
	of configs with an indented line at the very end.

0.6.8   20070802 - Ported fixes to the CiscoPassword class from the 
        cisco_decrypt package.  Notably, there were crashes when it was called
	with certain unencrypted passwords.

0.6.7   20070801 - Fixed bug where some methods didn't return False when no 
        diffs were found

0.6.6   20070730 - Added password decryption options to the command-line help
        menu.  Modified all diff functions to return False if no diffs are found

0.6.5   20070728 - Fixed another CiscoPassword bug. Added warning if 
        CiscoPassword decryption fails.  Added command-line functionality for 
	improved interoperability with other languages (and shell-usage if 
	you like).

0.6.1   20070726 - Cosmetic restructuring of code

0.6.0   20070721 - Revised APIs.  Existing APIs should be stable now
