0.9.16  20140212 Fix bug in ccp_abc.insert_before() and insert_after().  Made
        updates to README.rst.  Ripped out linenum references in various
        insert methods
0.9.15  20140210 Updated README.rst with inline example
0.9.14  20140209 Support for Travis CI.  Fix Travis CI build failures on
        Python3.3 (due to how __hash__() is computed).
0.9.13  20140209 Fixed Python3 compatibility, which broke a few builds ago.  
        Including ipaddr-py (patched for Python3) until versions of Python3 
        typically include it (right now, Debian 7.3 has Python3.2 without
        ipaddr-py)
0.9.12  20140208 Fixed bug in ccp_abc.py; reworked comment detection; performance improvements
0.9.11  20140204 Bugfixes
0.9.10  20140203 Bugfixes and more performance improvements.  Doubled
        number of unit tests. Added alpha-quality code in another module.
0.9.9   20140131 Major insert() / append() performance improvements.   Add
        optional interface-aware config line factory objects.  Add abstract base
        classes.  Add atomic options to insert_before(), insert_after(), etc...
0.9.8   20140124 Remove debugging info
0.9.7   20140124 Major rewrite, removed support for old python versions.  
        Ripped out inefficient code I wrote as a python newbie, added more
        idiomatic structures in various places.  Also added support for 
        inserting and deleting lines via insert_before(), insert_after(), and
        insert_after_child()
0.9.6   20140106 Update copyright to 2014.  Rewrite unit tests
0.9.5   20131231 Add replace_lines() function, enhance unit tests, 
        added an exactmatch option on _find_line_OBJ().  Updated code 
        copyright to include 2014
0.9.4   20130814 Add Python3 compliance; other minor tweaks
0.9.3   20130511 Added methods to IOSCfgLine: __eq__(), __hash__(), __lt__(), 
        __gt__(), as well as simplifying several other methods.  Misc code
        maintenance...
0.9.2   20130509 Add find_children_w_parents() method... tidy up unit-tests
0.9.1   20121231 Improve docs with numpydoc and intersphinx links.  Add
        more examples / doctests.  Renamed internal CiscoConfParse methods
        with a leading _ to make Sphinx documentation more intuitive...
0.9.0   20121230 Add RST documentation into the archives and fix more build 
        issues
0.8.6   20121230 Fix packaging problems introduced when I switched to a native
        mercurial repository (examples/* and configs/* were not automatically
        packaged in the .egg / .tar.gz anymore...)
0.8.5   20121229 - Added custom comment delimiters that were in the 0.8.3a private 
        build.  Converted the unicode backslash to a true unicode instance.
0.8.4   20121229 - Add doctests, code maintenance, and more documentation fixes.
        Improved examples/req_cfgspec_all_diff.py and 
        examples/req_cfgspec_excl_diff.py.
0.8.3   20091016 - Documentation updates.  PEP8 formatting
0.8.2   20090808 - Fixed a fatal crash in find_blocks()
0.8.1   20090719 - Code reorganization.  Fixed a bad RuntimeError.  Promoted to
        production-quality at this point
0.8.0   20071011 - Removed residual internal debugging from the CiscoPassword
        class.  Added an 'ignore_ws' options to all public methods, except
	req_cfgspec_excl_diff; this option will make the method's matches 
	ignore whitespace differences (useful in some CatOS configurations).  
	After much deliberation, I have removed the explicit 'False' return 
	values for methods that do not match; instead I am returning an empty 
	list (which will test False).  Apologies for breaking any existing 
	code, but I decided against leaving beta with this behavior.  Removed
	all sys.exit(0) statements in favor of raising a RuntimeError.

0.7.5   20070804 - Fixed a bug in the parse() method, which was associating
        grandchildren as children of the grandparent.   Added unit tests.

0.7.0   20070803 - Added an optional parameter to the find_lines(), 
        find_children(), find_all_children(), and find_blocks() methods.  This
	parameter will allow the user to specify whether he wants an "exact"
	match or a normal regex match.  Also fixed a bug that broke parsing
	of configs with an indented line at the very end.

0.6.8   20070802 - Ported fixes to the CiscoPassword class from the 
        cisco_decrypt package.  Notably, there were crashes when it was called
	with certain unencrypted passwords.

0.6.7   20070801 - Fixed bug where some methods didn't return False when no 
        diffs were found

0.6.6   20070730 - Added password decryption options to the command-line help
        menu.  Modified all diff functions to return False if no diffs are found

0.6.5   20070728 - Fixed another CiscoPassword bug. Added warning if 
        CiscoPassword decryption fails.  Added command-line functionality for 
	improved interoperability with other languages (and shell-usage if 
	you like).

0.6.1   20070726 - Cosmetic restructuring of code

0.6.0   20070721 - Revised APIs.  Existing APIs should be stable now
