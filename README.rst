Introduction: What is ciscoconfparse?
=====================================

Short answer: ciscoconfparse is a Python_ library that helps you quickly answer questions like these about your configurations:

- What interfaces are shutdown?
- Which interfaces are in trunk mode?
- What address and subnet mask is assigned to each interface?
- Which interfaces are missing a critical command?
- Is this configuration missing a standard config line?

It can help you:

- Audit existing router / switch / firewall / wlc configurations
- Modify existing configurations
- Build new configurations

Speaking generally, the library examines an IOS-style config and breaks it 
into a set of linked parent / child relationships.  You can perform complex 
queries about these relationships.

Usage
=====

The following code will parse a configuration stored in 'exampleswitch.conf'
and select interfaces that are shutdown.

.. code:: python

    from ciscoconfparse import CiscoConfParse

    parse = CiscoConfParse('exampleswitch.conf', syntax='ios')

    for intf_obj in parse.find_objects_w_child('^interface', '^\s+shutdown'):
        print("Shutdown: " + intf_obj.text)


The next example will find the IP address assigned to interfaces.

.. code:: python

    from ciscoconfparse import CiscoConfParse

    parse = CiscoConfParse('exampleswitch.conf', syntax='ios')

    for intf_obj in parse.find_objects('^interface'):

        intf_name = intf_obj.re_match_typed('^interface\s+(\S.+?)$')

        # Search children of all interfaces for a regex match and return 
        # the value matched in regex match group 1.  If there is no match, 
        # return a default value: ''
        intf_ip_addr = intf_obj.re_match_iter_typed(
            r'ip\saddress\s(\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+)\s', result_type=str,
            group=1, default='')
        print("{0}: {1}".format(intf_name, intf_ip_addr))

What if we don't use Cisco?
===========================

Don't let that stop you.

As of CiscoConfParse 1.2.4, you can parse `brace-delimited configurations`_ 
into a Cisco IOS style (see `Github Issue #17`_), which means that 
CiscoConfParse understands these configurations:

- Juniper Networks Junos
- Palo Alto Networks Firewall configurations
- F5 Networks configurations

CiscoConfParse also handles anything that has a Cisco IOS style of configuration, which includes:

- Cisco IOS, Cisco Nexus, Cisco IOS-XR, Cisco IOS-XE, Aironet OS, Cisco ASA, Cisco CatOS
- Arista EOS
- Brocade
- HP Switches
- Force 10 Switches
- Dell PowerConnect Switches
- Extreme Networks
- Enterasys
- Screenos


Docs
====

- The latest copy of the docs are `archived on the web <http://www.pennington.net/py/ciscoconfparse/>`_
- There is also a `CiscoConfParse Tutorial <http://pennington.net/tutorial/ciscoconfparse/ccp_tutorial.html>`_

.. _Pre-Requisites:

Pre-requisites
==============

ciscoconfparse_ requires Python versions 2.7 or 3.4+ (note: version 3.7.0 has 
a bug - ref Github issue #117, but version 3.7.1 works); the OS should not 
matter.

.. _Installation:

Installation and Downloads
==========================

You can install into Python2.x with pip_:

::

      pip install --upgrade ciscoconfparse

Use ``pip3`` for Python3.x...

::

      pip3 install --upgrade ciscoconfparse

If you don't want to use pip_, you can install with `easy_install`:

::

      easy_install -U ciscoconfparse


Otherwise `download it from PyPi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ciscoconfparse>`_, extract it and run the ``setup.py`` script:

::

      python setup.py install

If you're interested in the source, you can always pull from the `github repo`_
or `bitbucket repo`_:


- From github_:
  ::

      git clone git://github.com//mpenning/ciscoconfparse


.. _FAQ:

FAQ
===

#) *QUESTION*: I want to use ciscoconfparse_ with Python3; is that safe?  *ANSWER*: *ANSWER*: Yes.

#) *QUESTION*: Some of the code in the documentation looks different than what I'm used to seeing.  Did you change something?  *ANSWER*: Yes, starting around ciscoconfparse_ v0.9.10 I introducted more methods directly on ``IOSConfigLine()`` objects; going forward, these methods are the preferred way to use ciscoconfparse_.  Please start using the new methods shown in the example, since they're faster, and you type much less code this way.

#) *QUESTION*: ciscoconfparse_ saved me a lot of time, I want to give money.  Do you have a donation link?  *ANSWER*:  I love getting emails like this; helping people get their jobs done is why I wrote the module.  However, I'm not accepting donations.

#) *QUESTION*: Is there a way to use this module with perl?  *ANSWER*: Yes, I do this myself. Install the python package as you normally would and import it into perl with ``Inline.pm`` and ``Inline::Python`` from CPAN.

#) *QUESTION*: When I use ``find_children("interface GigabitEthernet3/2")``, I'm getting all interfaces beginning with 3/2, including 3/21, 3/22, 3/23 and 3/24. How can I limit my results?  *ANSWER*: There are two ways... the simplest is to use the 'exactmatch' option...  ``find_children("interface GigabitEthernet3/2", exactmatch=True)``. Another way is to utilize regex expansion that is native to many methods... ``find_children("interface GigabitEthernet3/2$")``
