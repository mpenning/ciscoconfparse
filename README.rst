.. _introduction:

Introduction: What is ciscoconfparse?
=====================================

ciscoconfparse_ parses, audits, queries, builds, and modifies Cisco IOS 
configurations.

Docs
====

The latest copy of the docs are `archived on the web <http://www.pennington.net/py/ciscoconfparse/>`_

.. _Pre-Requisites:

Pre-requisites
==============

ciscoconfparse_ needs  Python versions 2.6, 2.7 or 3.2+; the OS should not
matter. If you want to run it under a Python virtualenv_, it's been heavily 
tested in that environment as well.

.. _Installation:

Installation and Downloads
==========================

The best way to get ciscoconfparse is with setuptools_ or pip_.  If you 
already have setuptools_, you can install as usual:

::

      # Substitute whatever ciscoconfparse version you like...
      easy_install -U ciscoconfparse==1.1.13

Alternatively you can install into Python2.x with pip_:

::

      pip install --upgrade ciscoconfparse

Use ``pip3`` for Python3.x...

::

      pip3 install --upgrade ciscoconfparse

Otherwise `download it from PyPi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ciscoconfparse>`_, extract it and run the ``setup.py`` script:

::

      python setup.py install

If you're interested in the source, you can always pull from the `github repo`_
or `bitbucket repo`_:


- From github_:
  ::

      git clone git://github.com//mpenning/ciscoconfparse


- From bitbucket_:
  ::

      hg init
      hg clone https://bitbucket.org/mpenning/ciscoconfparse

standard library, starting in Python 3.3 (it's called ``ipaddress`` in Python3).

.. _FAQ:

FAQ
===

#) *QUESTION*: I want to use ciscoconfparse_ with Python3; is that safe?  *ANSWER*: As long as you're using Python 3.2 or higher, it's safe. I test every release against Python 3.2+.

#) *QUESTION*: Some of the code in the documentation looks different than what I'm used to seeing.  Did you change something?  *ANSWER*: Yes, starting around ciscoconfparse_ v0.9.10 I introducted more methods directly on ``IOSConfigLine()`` objects; going forward, these methods are the preferred way to use ciscoconfparse_.  Please start using the new methods shown in the example, since they're faster, and you type much less code this way.

#) *QUESTION*: ciscoconfparse_ saved me a lot of time, I want to give money.  Do you have a donation link?  *ANSWER*:  I love getting emails like this; helping people get their jobs done is why I wrote the module.  However, I'm not accepting donations.

#) *QUESTION*: Is there a way to use this module with perl?  *ANSWER*: Yes, I do this myself. Install the python package as you normally would and import it into perl with ``Inline.pm`` and ``Inline::Python`` from CPAN.

#) *QUESTION*: When I use ``find_children("interface GigabitEthernet3/2")``, I'm getting all interfaces beginning with 3/2, including 3/21, 3/22, 3/23 and 3/24. How can I limit my results?  *ANSWER*: There are two ways... the simplest is to use the 'exactmatch' option...  ``find_children("interface GigabitEthernet3/2", exactmatch=True)``. Another way is to utilize regex expansion that is native to many methods... ``find_children("interface GigabitEthernet3/2$")``

Bug Tracker and Support
=======================

ciscoconfparse Support
----------------------

Please report any suggestions, bug reports, or annoyances with 
ciscoconfparse_ through the `github bug tracker`_.

Python Support
--------------

If you're having problems with general python issues, consider searching for
a solution on `Stack Overflow`_.  If you can't find a solution for your problem
or need more help, you can `ask a question`_.

Cisco Support
-------------

If you're having problems with your Cisco devices, you can open a case with 
`Cisco TAC`_; if you prefer crowd-sourcing, you can ask on the Stack Exchange 
`Network Engineering`_ site.

.. _Contributing:

Contributing
============

ciscoconfparse_ is developed with mercurial_, and pushed to bitbucket_.  
`hg-git`_ keeps `github repo`_ and bitbucket_ in sync, so it shouldn't 
matter if you just want to fork the `github repo`_.

.. _Unit-Tests:

Unit-Tests
==========

I use the `Travis CI project <https://travis-ci.org>`_ to continuously test ciscoconfparse on Python versions 2.6 through 3.4.
